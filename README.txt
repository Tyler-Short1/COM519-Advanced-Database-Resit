You must change the IP in server.js line 107 to your local IP (which can be found using 'ipconfig' on windows) and potentially the port if there are conflict issues.
You must change the IP and PORT in WorkoutForm.js (line 24) & WorkoutList.js (lines 9 & 25) to the IP and PORT used in server.js.

RUN SERVER: Open Server directory (NOT SERVER.JS) in the terminal and use 'npm start'
RUN CLIENT: Open workout-tracker directory in the terminal and use 'npm start'.
